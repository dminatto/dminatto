### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m Dani and Iâ€™m a  ~problem solver~ professional software developer since 2013 but my first lines of code happened around ~2009. 
Of course I had no idea of what I was doing but I have interest and love for computing since I was 9 years old. 

Currently the areas I am most involved are web development, artificial intelligence and cybersecurity.

Technically, I've worked with several languages and platforms, such as: C++, ASP, VB6, .Net(C# e VB.NET), .Net Core, Entity Framework/Core, PHP (5.*, 7.*, frameworks: Slim, Twig, Eloquent and Laravel), AngularJS, Vue, Javascript, NodeJS, PowerBuilder, JWT, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, MySQL, CSS Processors, Web Analytics, Search Engines, Tasks Runners, HTML5 and others.

I believe the main objective of a software developer is making people's lives better and what really makes me feel safistied with my work is delivering solutions to people. 

I believe in power of women in technology, community power and potential to build|code|deploy the future of technology. 

Nowadays I work as tech lead of a software developers team in a telecom company.

I'm currently improving my English and deciding which language to learn next.
