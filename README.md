## 💻 About Me

I'm a passionate problem solver and professional software developer since 2013, though my coding journey began around 2009. My love for computing started when I was just 9 years old, and it has grown into a fulfilling career.

I believe the main objective of a software developer is to make people's lives better. What truly satisfies me is delivering solutions that make a real difference.

Currently focusing on:
- 🌐 Web Development
- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence

> I believe in the power of women in technology, community collaboration, and our collective potential to build | code | deploy the future of technology.
